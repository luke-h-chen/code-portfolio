# Assessing and Addressing Challenges to Identification of Covid-19 Policy Treatment Effects

## Abstract
During the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, many state and local governments enacted "stay-at-home" policies and mask mandates in an effort to curb virus transmission. Many studies have made noble efforts to quantify the effects of such policies as well as identify the determinants of their efficacy through cross-sectional and event-study research designs. However, the identifying assumptions necessary for correct identification are unlikely to be satisfied in the case of Covid-19 policies. In this paper, we assess some of the primary challenges to identification of policy effects and determinants of policy effects and attempt to address them with novel modeling.
